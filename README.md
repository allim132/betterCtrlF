This project was developed during the HACKUTA6 event.

The intent of this project is to serve as an educational tool to assist in retrieving information given a text pdf (i.e. a textbook or research paper). The user will upload a document and give a prompt. The model will attempt to find a relevant page to the prompt, alongside a chatbot that will be able to further answer questions based on the document.

We utilzied the RAG document and model recommended by Alex Jon Dilhoff.

Made in collaboration with Mia Sorola Yoshida, Kathleen Paz, and Alex Nguyen.
