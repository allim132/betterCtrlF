This project was developed during the HACKUTA6 event.

The intent of this project is to serve as an educational tool to assist in retrieving information given in a text pdf (i.e. a textbook or research paper). The user will upload a document and give a prompt. The model will attempt to find a relevant page to the prompt.

Made in collaboration with Mia Sorola Yoshida and Alex Nguyen.
